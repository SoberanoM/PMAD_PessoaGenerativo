a day of sun
 

I love the things that children love

yet with a comprehension deep

that lifts my pining soul above

those in which life as yet doth sleep 

all things that simple are and bright

unnoticed unto keen worn wit

with a child's natural delight

that makes me proudly weep at it 

I love the sun with personal glee

the air as if I could embrace

its wideness with my soul and be

A drunkard by expense of gaze 

i love the heavens with a joy

that makes me wonder at my soul

it is a pleasure nought can cloy

a thrilling I cannot control 

so stretched out here let me lie

before the sun that soaks me up

and let me gloriously die

drinking too deep of living's cup 

be swallowed of the sun and spread

over the infinite expanse

dissolved, like a drop of dew dead

lost in a super normal trance 

lost in impersonal consciousness

and mingling in all life become

a selfless part of Force and Stress

and have a universal home 

and in a strange way undefined

lose in the one and living Whole

the limit that I call my mind

the bounded thing I call my soul
